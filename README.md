Guess what? FSC College has started its own telecommunications company called FSC
Telecom. The benefit is great prepaid calling rates for all FSC students! The calling rate is
5 cents for one minute, and this includes both in-network (FSC Telecom) or out-network.
Also, SMS rates are only 2 cents each! The price is great, but this system is limited in
functionality. Postpaid accounts are not allowed; only prepaid accounts are allowed.
Additionally, the system has limited memory: it can only save into memory the last 10
outbound calls and the last 10 SMS messages that the user sends.
For this program, you will implement a basic simulation of this FSC Telecom system.
Students will make accounts, make calls, send messages, recharge their phones, and more.
You will create one linked-list, which will be used to manage all of the accounts (each node
of the linked list will be an object of type Student). You will use File I/O to read
commands from a file and then print the output to a file. Example commands are
ADDACCOUNT, MAKECALL, SENDTEXT, RECHARGE etc. Then, depending on the
command, you will either add a new account, process a phone call or text, search for a
student account, and more. But instead of printing to the console window (screen), you
will print to an output file
